**This example demonstrates:**
* Everything from single base route example
* Bottom navigation (library, favorites, user pages) persists across navigation
* Login and error pages are full screen (hide bottom navigation)
* Using the future result of push in user/authentication page
* Custom `Authenticated` mixin ensures user is authenticated (LibraryDL, FavoritesDL, UserDL)
